After years of involvement in athletics as an athlete, fan, and now high school coach, we’ve never had a central hub to efficiently browse through historical data or specific metrics from NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championship meets results over the years. Currently you have to Google search each individual meet, scroll to find the correct results link, identify the year and event you’re looking for and then repeat in order to compare over the years. 

So I decided to create and maintain a PostgreSQL database to house all the event data and specific metric points that may be of interest to the track and field community to allow for more efficiently comparisons, data browsing, and opportunities to visually see the progression of the evolution of track and field at one of the premier meets across the world. 

To start, I identified the initial sample size to begin collecting to begin documenting the process and time efforts to produce such a database with the end goal in mind. I decided to collect the data from the NCAA Men’s Division 1 Outdoor Track and Field Championships Meet for the 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2022 results. (Remember, NCAA 2020 seasons were cut short due to COVID-19)

Within this database you will be able to see the tables holding data relevant to Events, Years, Athletes, Teams, Time, Finals Qualifiers, Reaction Time, Wind Reading, and more
